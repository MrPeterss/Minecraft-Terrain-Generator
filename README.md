# Minecraft Terrain Generator
A simple tool for creating realistic terrain from real world data in Minecraft

## About the Web App
Users will first navigate to a web app that will allow them to select an area on a map.

The web app is a NextJS project written in Typescipt/TSX that allows users to select a bounding box area and create a "key" that the Minecraft Server will use that communicates their selection to said server. A picture of the site is below. As of right now keys are hardcoded in the API for testing purposes.

## About the Minecraft Plugin
The second part of the project is the Paper Minecraft Plugin, which users will have to download and instll on their own Minecraft servers. Once this plugin is installed, the user can run the command "/generator <key>" (replacing key with the key that is given on the web app after making a bounding box selection). The plugin will then begin to generate the area associated with the key. This part works fully as intended!

### How does the plugin work?
The plugin talks to the web app through HTTP requests, and also talks to Nextzen, a long-term support version of Mapzen API service, which takes "Terrainium" images and uses math to translate the image into a heightmap that can be used by the server to generate the world.
